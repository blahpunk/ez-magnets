# Resizable Magnet and Torrent Link Banner Userscript

## Description
This userscript creates a resizable, scrollable banner at the top of web pages to display all magnet and `.torrent` file links found on the page. It bypasses annoying redirects, URL masking, and click hijacking, ensuring easy access to content. The banner is styled for easy readability and includes copy-to-clipboard functionality for each link. The script also blocks all page scripts and hides the page content if magnet or torrent links are detected, displaying only the extracted links in the banner.

## Features
- Displays magnet and `.torrent` links in a fixed, resizable banner at the top of the page.
- Extracts and decodes magnet links, including `dn=` parameters.
- Parses `.torrent` file links, including query strings like `?title=...`.
- Bypasses click hijacking by removing event listeners and preventing popups.
- Hides and disables all page content if links are found.
- Scrollable banner with draggable resize handle for easy height adjustment.
- "Copy" button for each link to quickly copy the full magnet or `.torrent` URL.
- Reload button to restore original page content if needed.
- Banner automatically reprocesses links after the page finishes loading.

- Click the "Reload Page Content" button in the banner to restore the original page content.
